<h3 class="textTeal">Core Features</h3>
<p>Unlike other media-sharing tools, <span class="appName">Save</span> offers a suite of responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on community input and our commitment to digital inclusion. 
<br>
 <br>
 <span class="appName">Save</span> helps you:
  
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Authenticate Media:</i></b> With <span class="appName">Save</span>, you can be sure your media is always authenticated because you have full control—without interference from intermediaries—from phone to archive. And, when paired with Proofmode (available now for Android, iOS coming soon), you can even add sensor data to corroborate the metadata captured alongside your media.</li>
 <br>
  <li><b><i>Send Media via Secure Transit:</i></b> <span class="appName">Save</span> always uses TLS to ensure in-transit security and encryption. And, when you enable <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> for mobile (either via <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Orbot: Tor for Android</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448">Onion Browser</a> for iOS ), you add an additional layer of protection to ensure no one can intercept your media as it travels from your phone to the Internet Archive or your server of choice.</li>
<br>
 <li><b><i>Preserve Mobile Media for Long-Term Access:</i></b> When you use <span class="appName">Save</span> to archive your mobile media in a trusted repository committed to longevity and interoperability (such as the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> or <a href="https://owncloud.org/">OwnCloud</a>), you ensure unobstructed access to it for generations to come. This stands in stark contrast to popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.</li>
 <br>
 <li><b><i>Communicate Your Intentions for Future Use:</i></b> Through <span class="appName">Save</span> you can grant access to your shared media and communicate your intentions for future use by easily generating a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license allowing for others to reuse or remix your work.</li>
 <br>
 <li><b><i>Simplify Organizational Workflows:</i></b> <span class="appName">Save</span>'s easy-to-use design allows teams, as well as individuals, to seamlessly streamline media from many phones into organized folders unique to each contributor.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 class="textTeal">Additional Features</h3>

<p>With <span class="appName">Save</span> you can also:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b><i>Add Metadata and Flag Significant Content:</i></b> <span class="appName">Save</span> lets you add metadata to your archived media like location, people, and notes. You can also flag certain media as “significant” as a reminder to yourself, or to prepare reviewers for what they will see.</li>
     <br>
   <li><b><i>Import Media from Other Apps:</i></b> <span class="appName">Save</span> allows you to import and share media from other apps on your phone, including audio, notes, and pdfs.</li>
   <br>
   <li><b><i>Store Copies in Multiple Locations:</i></b> With <span class="appName">Save</span> you can further protect your media by creating and storing multiple copies on different secure servers. Whether hosting locally or remotely, your data can be encrypted on the backend and only accessible by you and those you authorize.</li>
   <br>
  <li><b><i>View Progress and Prioritize Uploads:</i></b> When storing media via <span class="appName">Save</span>, you can watch how much content has been uploaded and prioritize particular media over others.</li>
